Creating a custom theme
#######################

To create a custom theme, you need to copy the ``cradmin_base`` LESS library
into your own project. You will most likely also want to copy one of the
provided themes and extend that instead of just the common styles.


******************************
Prepartion - install bootstrap
******************************
You need to install Twitter bootstrap and ensure that you
have the bootstrap LESS files on your LESS path. You need
to have the following directory structure where ``somefolder``
is on your LESS path::

    somefolder/
        less/
            variables.less
            scaffolding.less
            .. and all the other bootstrap less files ..

In LESS terms this means that you should have a LESS setup
where bootstrap styles can be imported like this:

.. code-block:: css

    @import "bootstrap/less/something.less"

The easiest way of getting this is to use Bower::

    $ bower install bootstrap

and add ``bower_components/`` to your LESS path.


****************
Create the theme
****************
For this example we will assume you want to extend the default theme::

    $ cd django_cradmin_reporoot/django_cradmin/static/django_cradmin/src/less/
    $ cp -r cradmin_base cradmin_theme_default /path/where/you/store/your/less/files/

Next, create a directory for your theme, and add a ``theme.less`` file containing

.. code-block:: css

    @import "../cradmin_theme_default/theme";

    // Your custom styles here

You will typically want to mirror the structure of ``cradmin_base``, and create
a .less file in your theme directory for each file in ``cradmin_base/`` you override.
You will also typically want to use variables as much as possible. Lots of things
can be adjusted by just changing a couple of bootstrap and cradmin LESS variables.

How you build the theme is up to you, but you need to build ``yourtheme/theme.less``
and update the ``DJANGO_CRADMIN_THEME_PATH``-setting to point to your theme
(see :setting:`DJANGO_CRADMIN_THEME_PATH`).
